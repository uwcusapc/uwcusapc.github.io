				<h3>Submitting a composition</h3>
				<hr>
				<p>
				Writers should develop a composition which contains commentary on international affairs. Submissions will be examined by the Editorial Board before each publication is released. Submissions may also be published as they are received. A writer may specify "FOR NEXT PUBLICATION" or "FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE" when they submit their composition. The Editorial Board will look for the following characteristics in submissions:
				<ul>
					<li>Submissions should fit under the category of international affairs journalism. This contrasts compositions which might talk about the domestic affairs of a state.</li>
					<li>Submissions must be at least 200 words in length.</li>
					<li>Submissions must be in English.</li>
					<li>Submissions must have a clear subject and message.</li>
					<li>Submissions must be emailed to a member of the Editorial Board by the posted date.</li>
					<li>Submissions must have supporting arguments.</li>
					<li>Submissions must be of type digest or opinion:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Digest: compilation of existing opinions regarding a subject.</li>
						<li>Opinion: writer's original thought about a subject.</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
				Notes on submissions:
				<ul>
					<li>Although the Publication is not an academic research journal, submissions of a scholarly quality are expected.</li>
					<li>Writers may consider investigating the difference between advocacy, opinion, and news journalism. This may guide the writer in the composition of their submission.</li>
					<li>Writers are not required to adopt a certain writing style to have their compositions published. However, writers interested in journalism may consider investigating <a class="a-nonstandard" href="https://www.codot.gov/business/grants/safetygrants/documents/APStyleGuideCheatSheet.pdf">Associated Press Style</a>.</li>
